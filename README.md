# Chat App with socket.io

A chat app I started by following this [socket.io tutorial](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/#Introduction).

I plan to extend the app by first completing the suggestions listed at the bottom of the tutorial, which I converted to GitHub issues for this project. After that I'd like to customize the UI with React.
